This ACL system provides a light framework for supplying regex-style, sys-admin
friendly access control to any kind of application.

Any application can make use of the module, the example application is a perl
service that takes postfix style policy server declarations, converts them
into a native format, and checks them against a database of ACLs.

Note, that this intended for use strictly with Postfix systems, but rather
any system that requires an ACL: web-application, mail application, etc.

Todo:

- Create a better backend abstraction, to allow extensions to be added
  for ACL retreival, ie memcache, file, etc.

- Ensure that all ACLs are compiled once, and create a LRU cache
